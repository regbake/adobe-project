#adobe-proj

This is a project to show API connectivity and testing with mocha, chai, and karma.

#Testing

The big perk of testing with Karma is that you can choose which browsers your app will run in, I only use Chrome and Safari and will be testing in those.

#Karma Test
Karma is not set up to run with express, so mock data will be passed in with the test fixture. 

#Future work
Setting up Test Coverage (ie. Istanbul) would be helpful
